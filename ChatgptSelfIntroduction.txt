SELF INTRODUCTION


"My name is PASUPULETI SRI VENKATA SAI MAHESH, and I am passionate about Java full stack development. 
I have been worked in wipro for 1 year 10 months as a associate in mapping process, 
so i started focusing on both the frontend and backend.
My expertise includes creating responsive user interfaces with technologies like React,
while also handling server-side logic using Java and frameworks like Spring Boot. 
 I'm keen on building scalable, efficient applications that deliver great user experiences."

 A brief note on Java full stack development:
 
 Java full stack development refers to the practice of working on both the frontend and backend of web applications using Java technologies. 
 On the backend, Java is typically paired with frameworks 
 like Spring Boot to handle business logic, APIs, and database management.
 For the frontend, full stack developers often use modern JavaScript frameworks like React.
 A full stack developer is comfortable working with databases (SQL, NoSQL), handling API requests, and implementing user interfaces,
  making them versatile in handling all layers of the application stack.
